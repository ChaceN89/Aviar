redux extension on chrome is very useful

make sure you are in the right folder (root or frontend)
for each install i say which folder you are in


stuff you need to do is a bit further down

/*
you can skip this part
    don't need to do this since project is already started
    from root folder
    npx create-react-app frontend --template redux
                                    // add template flag
                -- including redux flag create an example project in fornt end folder
        this gives a bunch of examplke code snippets and a smallaexample porject

*/

    helpful command in case you make a mistake
    npm uninstall <name of thing you don't want>

    **for specific new installs you do need to be  in the frontend folder**

        npx create-react-app frontend --template redux 
            installs redex toolkit and react redux package

        generates  in frontend folder
        nodemodules
        public
        scr
        gitignore
        two package .json files
        readme

        many files are installed
        with lots of example code

    added "client": "npm start --prefix frontend" to 
    scritps in package.json in root folder for 

*****running client
    npm run client     now run the frontend
*****

    app.js contains main code
    added pages folder in src

    .jsx files are used

    easy tool to use is est + react/redux .....  native  .....
    extension 

    rfce enter on the pages sets things up for a blank page

when in doubt check the package.json files to see what you need



***dependencies***

cd into frontend folder

            //for routing
        npm i react-router-dom  // set up routes for pages

            //for icons 
        npm i react-icons // set up 

Root folder

can jsut 

    for running server and cleint as same time, can run two command prompt same
    or
    add    npm i -D concurrently in the root folder   (just makes things easier)



in package.json in root 
ass to scripts 
"dev": "concurrently \"npm run server\" \"npm run client\"",

npm run dev  to run both


in fontr end folder for authentication

install axios
npm i axios react-toastify 
//show alerts

add to package.json in front end
"proxy": "http://localhost:5000",
to get corrent endpooint in authservice




make sure to set to production before builod
NODE_ENV = production 

npm run build      in the front end folder to create build folder

heroku for setting up application 

last video shows how to set up
